**Firetower is a control plane for coding agents.**

It lets you orchestrate your favorite coding agents on your local computer or any remote server through an SSH tunnel.

Give it a server you can SSH into and a repository, describe some work, and it picks a host, cuts a branch, makes a worktree, starts tmux, launches the agent, and keeps it running.

And yes, it works with your own subscription (Claude Code, Codex, etc.).

## Why is Firetower different?

Alternatives like Orca and Paseo are excellent desktop products that reach outward. Their agents run on your laptop, and remote execution is a mode bolted on afterward: a relay daemon over SSH, a headless Electron under Xvfb, a control plane that dies when you close the lid. 

Firetower starts from the other end. The control plane is a server by design, it never touches the public internet, and the laptop is only a client among others. Agents run on machines that don't sleep, in isolated worktrees with real resource limits, using each developer's own subscriptions and credentials.

```

You drive it from the desktop app on macOS and Windows, or from your phone on iOS and Android. Both reach the control plane over HTTPS on your Tailscale network, so it never has to be exposed to the public internet.

The control plane can run on your local computer or a remote server. It allows you to orchestrate the agent, manage your repositories, your secrets, and user accounts.

The workers can run locally or on any remote server as well. Their only job is to pull a repository, start a task into a new worktree, and run the coding agent.

The control plane and the worker communicate entirely through SSH, and you can close and reopen the connection at any time.

## Running it

To install the control plane, on a Linux server:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://usefiretower.com/install.sh | sh
```

Everything after that happens in the desktop app: adding workers, connecting repositories, secrets, and updating Firetower itself.
