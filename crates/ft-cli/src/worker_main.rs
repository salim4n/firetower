//!
//! A separate binary because the name mattered. `firetower` is what a person
//! types — `@firetower/cli` installs its own `bin` under that name, to install
//! and upgrade workers — and the control plane was asking a machine for
//! `firetower worker --stdio`. On a host with the CLI on it, PATH answered with
//! the CLI, which knows nothing about `--stdio` and said so:
//!
//! ```text
//! error: unknown option '--stdio'
//! ```
//!
//! naming neither program. The fix is not to argue over the name: it is to stop
//! asking for a human's command. Nobody types this one.
//!
//! It is also the build the `server` feature was written for — no axum, no
//! database, no embedded web application — and the one `install/worker.sh`
//! puts on a machine.
//!
//! `localhost` does not come through here. That worker is spawned from the
//! control plane's own executable by absolute path, so it has never been a
//! question of what PATH holds.
