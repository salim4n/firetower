//! Turning what a Codex app-server says into [`TurnEvent`]s.
//!
//! The sibling of [`normalise`](crate::normalise), for a protocol that is
//! shaped nothing like Claude Code's and needs far less work.
//!
//! Where Claude Code streams *frames* — a block opened, a fragment arrived, a
//! message finished — and leaves the lifecycle to be reconstructed, Codex
//! sends the lifecycle directly: `item/started`, `item/completed`,
//! `turn/started`, `turn/completed`. Almost every event here is one
//! notification renamed, and this file is mostly a vocabulary translation.
//!
//! Which means the state this holds is nearly nothing, and the two things it
//! does hold are worth naming:
//!
//! - **The thread id**, because a turn cannot be started without it and it is
//!   only ever said once, in the answer to `thread/start`.
//! - **Which items are which kind**, because `item/completed` gives the whole
//!   item again but the interface has already drawn a card and needs to know
//!   what it was.
//!
//! Runs in the control plane like its sibling, for the same reason: a mapping
//! that turns out to be wrong is a deploy rather than a fleet upgrade.
