//! The things about a running session somebody can change.
//!
//! Which knobs a session has is a fact about the agent it runs, not about the
//! screen. It lived in the browser as three constants for as long as there was
//! one agent to be right about; a second one made every list wrong, and the
//! mechanism wrong with it — Claude Code reads slash commands out of ordinary
//! input, and Codex takes the same settings as parameters on every turn.
//!
//! So this says what the choices *are*. How one is put into force belongs to
//! whatever is driving the agent.
