//! Turning what Claude Code prints into [`TurnEvent`]s.
//!
//! Claude Code run headless writes one JSON object per line. Those lines are
//! *frames* — a block opened, a fragment of text, a message finished — while
//! the interface needs *lifecycles*: this item started, grew, ended. Bridging
//! the two is the whole job here, and it is why this is a struct with state
//! rather than a function: correlating a `tool_result` with the `tool_use` it
//! answers means remembering the latter.
//!
//! ## Where this runs, and why it matters
//!
//! In the control plane, not on the worker. Workers live on other people's
//! machines and are upgraded rarely; when an agent changes the shape of its
//! output, a control plane is a deploy and a fleet is a negotiation. Keeping
//! the raw lines as what Firetower stores has a second payoff: a mapping that
//! turns out to be wrong can be corrected and the history re-derived, rather
//! than migrated or lost.
//!
//! ## On guessing
//!
//! Claude Code does not say what kind of thing a tool is. It says `Bash`,
//! `Edit`, `mcp__linear__create_issue`, and it grows new ones between releases.
//! So [`classify`] guesses from the name, and the guess is allowed to be wrong:
//! anything unrecognised becomes [`ItemKind::Unknown`], which draws a generic
//! card with the tool's name, input and output. Being wrong costs a nicer card.
//! It never costs the event.
