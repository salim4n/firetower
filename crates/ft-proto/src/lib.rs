//! The wire protocol between the control plane and a worker.

//! Frames travel over any bidirectional byte stream. The worker never opens a

//! a websocket — that's what lets the same daemon serve a laptop today and a

/// Bumped when a frame changes shape incompatibly. Checked during the handshake.
///
/// 6 — `CreateWorkspace` gathered the checkout into an optional `RepoSpec`, so
/// a session can have no repository. An older worker accepts the handshake and
/// then cannot parse the frame, which is a session that hangs in `Starting`
/// with nothing recorded. That is precisely what this number exists to stop,
/// and it only works if it is bumped.
///
/// 8 — an agent that speaks a structured protocol is watched rather than
/// attached to. A worker from before this understands neither the frames that
/// drive one nor the ones that report it, and a session on it would show an
/// empty conversation with no indication why.
///
/// 9 — the agent's own terminal is gone, along with typing at it. `Pty` now
/// names only the shell somebody opens for themselves, and an older worker
/// would read a shell frame as a request to attach to the agent.
///
/// 10 — a session holds any number of repositories. `CreateWorkspace.repo`
/// became `repos`, each carrying the setup, environment file and credential
/// that used to sit beside it; and the git actions name which checkout they
/// mean. An older worker would read a two-repository session as none at all.
///
/// 11 — a workspace can be searched by filename. An older worker has no
/// `FindFiles` and would fail to read the frame asking for one, taking the
/// connection down with it rather than answering "I can't".
///
/// 12 — raw TCP travels over this connection, so a port a session is serving
/// on can be reached without anything listening on the machine it runs on. An
/// older worker cannot read `TunnelOpen`, and a preview against one would take
/// the connection down rather than answering "I can't".
/// 13 — acknowledged agent launches and isolated per-run authentication.
/// 15 — KimiCode and its ACP journal require an ACP-aware worker.
/// 16 — ACP configuration commands require a worker that can apply them.
/// 17 — signing in names its agent, so Kimi can use the device flow too.
