//! Who is allowed in.
//!
//! Until accounts existed, the only thing protecting every credential Firetower
//! holds was that it listened on loopback. That is a defence on a laptop and
//! none at all on a server.
//!
//! Two ways to satisfy this, and a deployment picks one:
//!
//! 1. **Signing in.** A username and password produce a session, and the
//!    session's token is what every later request carries. This is the normal
//!    path and the one the interface uses.
//! 2. **A header a proxy sets.** `FIRETOWER_TRUSTED_PROXY_HEADER=X-Forwarded-Email`
//!    hands identity to whatever is already in front — Cloudflare Access,
//!    Authelia, oauth2-proxy, Caddy's `forward_auth`. Firetower does not learn
//!    to speak OIDC; it learns to believe something that already does. The
//!    header still has to name somebody who exists here.
//!
//! Both produce a [`Principal`] carrying the **user**, not a yes. A password
//! that only answered "somebody" would make every later question about who did
//! what unanswerable.
//!
//! **The trap this file exists to avoid.** A trusted header is only worth the
//! network in front of it. If a request can reach Firetower without passing the
//! proxy, anyone can set that header and be anyone — so it is believed only
//! from an address in `FIRETOWER_TRUSTED_PROXY`, and configuring the header
//! without that list stops start-up rather than quietly trusting the internet.
