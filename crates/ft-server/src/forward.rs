//! A port on this machine, standing in for one inside a session.
//!
//! The whole feature, and it does not know what HTTP is. A listener on
//! loopback, and for each connection a [`Tunnel`] carrying the bytes to a port
//! inside the worker's container. Nothing is parsed, nothing is rewritten,
//! nothing is injected.
//!
//! **Why a real port rather than a path under the interface.** Serving an
//! application at `/preview/<session>/3000/` means rewriting what it says: a
//! `<base>` tag for its relative URLs, its `Location` headers, and a guess from
//! the `Referer` for everything root-relative. The first client-side
//! `history.pushState("/dashboard")` then moves the page out of the prefix and
//! the guess stops working. A real port has an origin of its own, so there is
//! nothing to rewrite and nothing to break — client-side routers, service
//! workers and hot-reload sockets all work because none of them can tell.
//!
//! **And the port number is the same one.** A frontend that talks to its
//! backend at `http://localhost:8000` is normally unfixable from a remote
//! machine. Forward the worker's `:8000` onto this machine's `:8000` and the
//! hardcoded address is simply correct.
//!
//! **The one topology this does not serve** is a control plane that is not on
//! the machine holding the browser. The port would be opened next to the
//! control plane, where nobody is looking. [`Forwards::available_here`] is how
//! the interface knows not to offer it.
