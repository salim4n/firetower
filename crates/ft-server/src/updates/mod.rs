//! Upgrading Firetower from Firetower.
//!
//! The control plane already knows what version everything is: its own from
//! the build, each worker's from the handshake. What it did not know was what
//! the newest release is, and it had no way to move anything — the operator
//! went to the machine for `firetower upgrade`, and to each worker's machine
//! for `firetower worker upgrade`. This module is both of those, from the
//! screen.
//!
//! ## Who does what
//!
//! * **Workers** are reinstalled by the control plane, over the same ssh path
//!   a connection takes — the installer script, pinned to the version being
//!   moved to. The key never goes anywhere it did not already go.
//! * **The control plane** cannot recreate itself, so an updater container
//!   beside it does — see [`client`] and the `ft-updater` crate. The updater
//!   holds the Docker socket and nothing else: no key, no password, no
//!   database.
//! * **The CLI** on the operator's own machine is out of reach. The most this
//!   can do is say which version a release wants.
//!
//! A run is a row and its steps are rows — see [`store`] — so the process
//! being replaced in the middle of one is the ordinary case, handled in
//! [`runs::resume`].
//!
//! Nothing here is automatic. A check every few hours says what is available;
//! a person starts a run.
