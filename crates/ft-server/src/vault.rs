//! The secret store.
//!
//! Everything Firetower holds on your behalf lives here: the token a git host
//! issued, the token an agent authenticates with. One table, encrypted, with a
//! log of every time a value was read and what it was read for.
//!
//! **Why the database and not the system keychain.** A keychain belongs to one
//! machine and one logged-in human. Firetower hands credentials to workers on
//! other machines, and to a container with no desktop session at all — so the
//! store has to be somewhere every part of the control plane can reach, and
//! that is the database. Which means the database now holds credentials, which
//! means they have to be encrypted, which is what [`crypto`] is for.
//!
//! **What is never in the log.** The value. Entries record what was touched and
//! why, never what it was, and nothing here writes a secret into a log line, an
//! error message, or a `Debug`.
//!
//! Three ways to open one, and they are different events on purpose:
//! [`Vault::holds`] decrypts nothing and is what a screen calls to ask whether
//! one is set; [`Vault::get`] is a session about to use a credential;
//! [`Vault::reveal`] is a person looking at one. Only the last two log.
//!
//! **What workers get.** A value, once, over the stream, at the moment a
//! workspace starts — as an environment variable for the process that needs it.
//! No worker stores one. Losing a worker loses nothing; the store is here.
