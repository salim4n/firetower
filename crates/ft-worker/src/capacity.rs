//! What this machine has, and what of it Firetower is using.
//!
//! Reported to the control plane so a person choosing where to put work can see
//! whether there is room for it, and so a workspace that was stopped for going
//! over its memory can say so instead of looking like a crash.
//!
//! ## Whose disk is whose
//!
//! Two numbers, deliberately. `disk_used_mb` is the machine's, and it is here
//! as context — a host at 98% is worth knowing about wherever the bytes came
//! from. `disk_firetower_mb` is ours: images our sessions pulled, the cache
//! their builds left, the containers they started. Only the second is ever
//! offered for clearing, because the rest of that disk belongs to whoever owns
//! the machine and tidying it is not Firetower's to offer.
//!
//! ## Why the reclaimable figure is not Docker's
//!
//! `docker system df` calls an image reclaimable when no container is running
//! from it, which on a daemon shared by every session on a worker describes
//! every image the next session was about to use. Reclaiming on that number
//! would empty the image cache the worker's volume exists to keep — the one
//! whose absence makes every upgrade cost a fresh pull of postgres and node.
//!
//! So the safe figure here is the build cache, which is rebuildable by
//! definition and costs time rather than anything else. What Docker calls
//! reclaimable is carried separately, for an interface to offer as the
//! deliberate choice it is.
