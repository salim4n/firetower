//! Asking the agent what it would call its own work.
//!
//! A pull request needs a title and a body, and the moment a session hands back
//! is the moment something on that machine knows most about what changed. So it
//! is asked, and the answer waits in the review sheet as a draft rather than as
//! an empty box.
//!
//! ## Why this is a separate run, not a turn in the session
//!
//! Both were possible. Asking inside the session gives the whole conversation
//! as context, and costs the session: a hidden turn is still a turn — it lands
//! in the log, spends tokens, and moves the context meter of the session
//! somebody is about to carry on working in. It also cannot answer at all for a
//! session that has ended, and a branch is still worth shipping after its
//! workspace is gone.
//!
//! This runs its own short-lived agent instead, on the same host, and is handed
//! the context that made a turn tempting: the diff, *and* what was actually
//! said. [`crate::history::recap`] already reduces an agent's log to the
//! conversation — which is where the reasoning lives, and where an issue number
//! somebody mentioned in passing appears. The diff says what changed; the talk
//! says why, and what else it was about.
//!
//! It runs where the code is. The control plane never sees the diff or the
//! conversation, and gains no second opinion about work it did not watch. What
//! it does send is the credential this run authenticates with: a run started by
//! the worker daemon inherits none of the session's environment, so the token
//! the session was launched with is not here, and the vault is the only place
//! another copy exists.
