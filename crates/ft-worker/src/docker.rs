//! The Docker daemon this worker has, and what a session leaves behind in it.
//!
//! ## Not ours to start
//!
//! The daemon belongs to the container, started by its entrypoint before this
//! binary exists. It has to: `firetower-worker --stdio` is one process per
//! control-plane connection and dies with it, so a daemon parented here would
//! take every running compose stack down on each reconnect — the thing tmux
//! exists to prevent. What this module does is *observe* it, which is the part
//! that was actually worth knowing, and clear up after the sessions that used
//! it.
//!
//! ## One daemon, many sessions
//!
//! A worker container is created per **host**, not per session, and every
//! session on that host shares this daemon. Two consequences that are stated
//! rather than hidden — in the workspace guide an agent reads, and in the
//! documentation:
//!
//! - The published-port space is shared. Two sessions both mapping `3000:3000`
//!   collide, and the second one to start is the one that fails.
//! - `docker ps` in one session lists another session's containers.
//!
//! Which is why teardown cannot be "remove the container it ran in" — there
//! isn't one. It is [`sweep`], by label, and everything a session starts has
//! to carry one for that to work.
