Docker and `docker compose` work here — bring the stack up and check your work against it rather than reasoning about whether it would run.

This daemon is shared with the other sessions on this machine, so:

- Published ports are shared. If a port is taken, another session has it; pick another rather than assuming something is broken.
- `docker ps` lists their containers too. Yours are the ones in the `{project}` project.
- Anything you start with `docker compose` is removed when this session ends. For a bare `docker run`, add `--label {label}={id}` and it will be cleared up too — without it, it is left behind.
