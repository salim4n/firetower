//! The agents this machine can run, and where they came from.
//!
//! Each agent is fetched as the standalone binary its publisher ships — Claude
//! Code and Kimi Code from their own download services, Codex from its GitHub
//! releases — and kept under the worker's state directory, one per version:
//!
//! ```text
//! <state>/agents/claude-code/2.1.0/bin/claude
//! <state>/agents/codex/0.154.0/bin/codex
//! <state>/agents/codex/0.154.0/bin/codex-code-mode-host
//! <state>/agents/kimi/2.1.1/bin/kimi
//! ```
//!
//! Codex is two binaries, and both of them are Codex — see `CODE_MODE_HOST`.
//!
//! Not through npm. All three publish an npm package and all three were
//! installed from it once, which made Node a requirement of every machine a
//! worker ran on — and Node is exactly the thing people install through a
//! version manager, into a directory only their interactive shell knows
//! about. A worker started by sshd or launchd never saw it. A binary in a
//! directory this module chose needs nothing on the machine but `curl` and
//! `tar`, and is found by the `PATH` the worker builds itself.
//!
//! **Nothing here touches a credential.** Installing a binary and signing it
//! in are separate acts, and only the first happens on this machine: what an
//! agent authenticates with is held by the control plane and handed over per
//! session.
