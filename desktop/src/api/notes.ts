 * Replying to a long turn is hard in one box: three things are wrong in three
 * places, and by the time you have written the third you have stopped being
 * specific about the first. So each one is written where it applies, against
 * the words it applies to, and they all go at once.
 *
 * ## They are a draft, and live in the browser
 *
 * Nothing here reaches the control plane until they are sent — sending them is
 * an ordinary message, which is the whole trick: no new frame, no new endpoint,
 * and the agent needs to understand nothing it does not already.
 *
 * They survive a reload, because losing six notes to a stray refresh is the
 * kind of thing that stops somebody using a feature. They live only in the
 * browser that made them: they are a person mid-thought, not a fact about the
 * session.
