/**
 * The conversation, off the stream.
 *
 * Everything drawn here comes from `useConversation` in
 * `web/src/api/conversation.ts` — the fold from lifecycle events into items,
 * requests, questions, tasks, plan, usage and mode. That fold is the contract;
 * this file only decides how each thing looks at desk size.
 *
 * Two rules taken from the web build rather than re-derived, because both were
 * got wrong here first:
 *
 * - **Runs of scaffolding fold.** `src/api/steps.ts` groups three or more
 *   consecutive commands / reads / searches into one disclosure and never folds
 *   an edit, because an edit is the work. Ten `ran ls` rows are one line.
 * - **Prose is markdown.** The agent writes it; `components/Markdown.tsx`
 *   renders it with raw HTML off, so a session cannot inject markup.
 *
 * The approval card is the one loud thing. The agent is genuinely stopped while
 * it is up — the tool call is held open on the host — and it can sit there for
 * hours; the session picks up where it was.
