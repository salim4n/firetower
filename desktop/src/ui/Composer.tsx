/**
 * Saying something to the agent — for real.

 * A message is not keystrokes: pictures go inside it, because the model looks
 * at them; every other file goes into the workspace with `attach_file` and is
 * only *named* in the message, because the agent has its own tools for reading
 * one and sending the bytes twice is waste. Both rules are the web build's.
 *
 * The pickers are drawn from what the agent reports it can change
 * (`session_controls`), not from a list kept here — a Codex session must not be
 * offered Opus. Choosing shows as chosen straight away (`remember`) because
 * Claude Code restates the model only at the start of the next turn, and the
 * server's answer overwrites it, so a refused request corrects itself.
 *
 * The meter is the agent's own report of its context window, off the last
 * finished turn. Adding up deltas here would drift.

              Labels come from whichever agent this is and some are long —
              `Workspace + network`, `gpt-6.1-sol`. They used to wrap *inside* a
              fixed-height control, which put two lines of text in a 28px box
              and read as overlapping junk. Each control is one line now
              (`.control` says so), and when they no longer fit they move onto
              a second line whole, which is the one way this degrades without
              anything becoming unreadable.

              Squeezing them instead was tried and is worse: four controls
              sharing a narrow column shrink to `G…`, `Ask …` and an Effort
              button with no word in it at all. */}

 * What a caution looks like — and only one of the two gets a colour.

 * `grants` is the fence coming down, which is brick: the signal this palette
 * already spends on destruction.
 *
 * `neverAsks` deliberately gets **nothing**. It was red, alongside
 * "Everything", and it does not widen anything — Claude Code's `dontAsk`
 * refuses what it may not do and Codex's `never` fails. Ember is the obvious
 * second tone and is the one colour that must not be borrowed: `STYLE.md` opens
 * with "ember is the only loud thing on screen… it stops answering [is
 * something waiting on you] the moment it answers anything else", and the same
 * file rules out inventing a fourth hue. So the distinction is carried by the
 * note under the label, which already says what happens, and the alarm stays
 * spent on the one option that earns it.
