/**
 * The Tasks page, asked the one question it used to get wrong.
 *
 * `/tasks` answers for one tracker per request and defaults to GitHub when
 * `source` is left off, so a page that never sends it can never show a Linear
 * ticket however well connected Linear is. These render against a seeded cache
 * keyed by the exact parameters: a row only appears if the page asked the
 * question this key was stored under, which is what makes "did it send
 * `source`" something a test can see.
