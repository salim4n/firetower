/**
 * Starting work.
 *
 * A workspace is a checkout on a machine with agents in it, so the form has to
 * ask for all three — and the contract is `NewSession`, not what seems like
 * enough. A form asking for a name, one repository and a first message is a
 * plausible-looking form that cannot express half of what a workspace is:
 * several repositories cut at different bases, which machine, whose
 * subscription, and how it competes for that machine when other agents are
 * already on it.
 *
 * The layout is this client's own; the fields, their meaning and the payload
 * are the web build's, because there is one control plane and it has one idea
 * of what starting work means.
 *
 * ## No prompt is sent, ever
 *
 * Including from a task. The agent starts and waits; what you want doing is
 * said in the conversation, where it can be answered. A task seeds the
 * composer instead, unsent. That rule is the whole reason this form has no
 * "what should it do" box, and it is not an omission.
 *
 * ## What the phone changes
 *
 * Six fields do not fit on 390pt, and a wizard would hide the one thing people
 * change most (the repository) behind three taps. So it is one scrolling form
 * with the pickers as panels, and the action pinned to the foot — the same
 * decision as the Commit tab, for the same reason.
