/**
 * Finding out whether there is a Firetower at an address, and what it is.
 *
 * `GET /api/v1/bootstrap` is unauthenticated and cheap, which is what makes it
 * the right first move: the client can name the organisation, the version and
 * how to sign in **before** it asks anybody for a password. Typing the address
 * of the wrong company's Firetower should be caught by reading its name, not by
 * handing it your credentials and seeing what happens.
 *
 * Ported from `desktop/src/probe.ts`, with one branch deliberately gone.
 *
 * ## There is no "refused" here
 *
 * The desktop has a third outcome between *reachable* and *not*: a server that
 * answered but would not talk to the app, because a webview's pages have an
 * origin and the control plane's CORS allowlist may not contain it. React
 * Native's `fetch` is not a browser — it sends no `Origin` and enforces no
 * same-origin policy — so that state cannot occur, and the `no-cors` probe the
 * desktop uses to tell the two apart has nothing to tell apart.
 *
 * This also means `CLIENT_ORIGINS` in `ft-server` needs no new entry for the
 * phone. Worth writing down, because it is the first thing anybody will ask.
