 * middle of it.
 *
 * So consecutive tool calls fold into one row, closed. Nothing is hidden that
 * was not already one click away: a `Tool` row shows a verb and an argument
 * and puts its input and output behind a fold, and this puts the row itself
 * behind one more.
 *
 * Deliberately not a component. The rules below are a list transform with
 * edges — a run broken by prose, a step still running, a failure inside a
 * group — and each of those is worth a test that does not need React to run.
