/**
 * Saying something to the agent.
 *
 * The thing an app is judged on in the first ten seconds, so the behaviour is
 * spelled out rather than left to a library's defaults.
 *
 * ## It is two shapes, not one
 *
 * **At rest it is a pill** — one row, compact. It is furniture; the
 * conversation is the screen and the composer should not take a sixth of it to
 * say nothing.
 *
 * **Writing in it, it is a card** — the text gets lines of its own and the
 * controls drop to a second row. The desk says *the composer is the
 * second-heaviest object on the screen*; it is only the second-heaviest while
 * you are using it.
 *
 * The morph is one layout transition on the UI thread, not two components
 * swapped — the `TextInput` holds the same slot in the tree throughout, so
 * focus, selection and the keyboard never notice it happened. It keeps the
 * same inset from both edges in both shapes: sliding the card outward on focus
 * put two things in motion where one would do, and the extra 8pt bought
 * nothing you could read.
 *
 * ## Three ways out, because a card you cannot put away is a trap
 *
 * Sending, blurring, and **dragging it down**. The drag is the one people
 * reach for without being told, and it works with a draft in the box: the
 * words are kept and shown in the pill, and tapping brings them back.
 *
 * ## The rest
 *
 * - **It moves with the keyboard, not after it.** `KeyboardStickyView` reads
 *   the keyboard's real frame every frame on the UI thread.
 * - **It grows with the text**, smoothly — the measured content height drives
 *   an animated wrapper rather than the field itself, so the box eases open a
 *   line at a time without the caret ever jumping.
 * - **Six lines, then it scrolls.**
 * - **Enter is a newline; the button sends.** `⏎ send` is a hardware-keyboard
 *   convention and inverting it on a phone loses half the messages people
 *   write. `⌘⏎` sends when a hardware keyboard is attached.
 * - **Send becomes stop while the agent works** — the same button in the same
 *   place, because reaching for a different one while something is running is
 *   the wrong moment to make somebody aim.
 * - **Dictating replaces the controls with a wave**, and the words appear
 *   above it as they are heard. See `Waveform`.
