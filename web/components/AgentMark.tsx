/**
 * Which agent, as a shape rather than a word.
 *
 * Every row that names an agent used to spend a line on the lowercase string
 * `claudecode`, which is both the least interesting thing about the row and the
 * hardest part of it to skim. A mark is read at a glance and costs no width, so
 * the line underneath can say something worth reading instead.
 *
 * Drawn rather than fetched. These sit in a rail that renders on every poll,
 * they have to tint with the row they are in, and an interface that is meant to
 * build offline cannot go to somebody's CDN for a logo.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* the vendors' logos. These are our own glyphs standing for
 * "the thing with the star" and "the thing with the rings" — close enough to
 * tell apart at 14px, and not a trademark we are redistributing.
